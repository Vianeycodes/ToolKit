  <h3> ðŸ’¡ Fun Fact </h3>
<p>Did you know? 81% of first-gen college students reported financial stability as their goal for attending college.</p>
<p>That is my personal goal as well, to be financially stable and get the career I want. I want to be better than I was yesterday
  and by going to college I personally am honoring my parents sacrifices, by getting the education they never had access to.</p>
